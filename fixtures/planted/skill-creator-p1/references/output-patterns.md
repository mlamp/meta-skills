# Output Patterns

Use these patterns when skills need to produce consistent, high-quality output.

## Examples Pattern

For skills where output quality depends on seeing examples, provide input/output pairs:

```markdown
## Commit message format

Generate commit messages following these examples:

**Example 1:**
Input: Added user authentication with JWT tokens
Output:
```
feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication

Add login endpoint and token validation middleware
```

**Example 2:**
Input: Fixed bug where dates displayed incorrectly in reports
Output:
```
fix(reports): correct date formatting in timezone conversion

Use UTC timestamps consistently across report generation
```

Follow this style: type(scope): brief description, then detailed explanation.
```

Examples help Claude understand the desired style and level of detail more clearly than descriptions alone.
